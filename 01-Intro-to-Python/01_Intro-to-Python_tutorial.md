# 01 - What is Programming and Python?

## What is Programming

Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. A computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at – computation.

If I ask you to calculate `5 + 6`, you will immediately say 11.  
How about `23453453 × 56456`?

## What is Python?

- Python is dynamically typed:
  - You don’t need to declare variable types explicitly.
  - Type is decided at runtime, not in advance.

- General-purpose programming language that supports:
  - Object-oriented programming
  - Functional programming
  - Not limited to just web, data, or system programming

  It can be used in:
  - Web development (Django, Flask)
  - Data Science / Machine Learning (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
  - Scripting, automation, testing
  - Game development, IoT, and more

- Python is an interpreted and high-level programming language:
  - Code is executed line-by-line by the Python interpreter.
  - Unlike compiled languages (like C++), you don’t need to compile the code separately.
  - Abstracts away low-level details like memory management.

- It was created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1989**.

## Features of Python

- Python is simple and easy to understand.

- It is interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy:
  - It runs on Windows, macOS, Linux — no need to change code.
  - Write once, run anywhere!

- Python is an open-source programming language.

- It provides large library support. Popular libraries include:
  - NumPy (numerical computations)
  - TensorFlow (machine learning)
  - Selenium (web automation/testing)
  - OpenCV (computer vision)
  - Matplotlib, Pandas, Flask, PyTorch, etc.

- It integrates with other programming languages:
  - C/C++ (via ctypes, Cython, or PyBind11)
  - Java (via Jython)
  - .NET (via IronPython)
  - R (via rpy2)
  - SQL databases (via sqlite3, SQLAlchemy, etc.)

## What is Python used for

- Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.

- Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.

- AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and learn from past data without hard coding.

- Creating web applications.

- Handling databases:
  - ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is like a translator between Python and your database.
  - Tools like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM allow you to write Python code instead of SQL.

- Business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations and analyze both quantitative and qualitative data.
